Practicing some HTML, CSS, and Javascript by creating a simple web-based tool that allows users to upload an image and calculate its aspect ratio. 

Users can either drag and drop an image into the designated area or select a file from their computer, displaying the image's dimensions and its simplified aspect ratio.

Future improvements include:

- **Image format validation**: Ensure only images are uploaded.
- **Multiple file support**: Allow users to upload and compare multiple images at once.
- **Aspect Ratio Customization**: Add an option to input custom dimensions and calculate their aspect ratio.
- **Drag Tool**: Allow users to take specific parts of their original image or change the size.
